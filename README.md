# K-means-Clustering
Clustering analysis. his project utilized the "McDonaldsMenu.csv" dataset to perform clustering analysis. The data was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and normalizing the values. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the WSS (Knee Plot) and Silhouette Coefficient methods. K-Means clustering was then applied, and the results were visualized. Cluster labels were added to the original dataset, creating cluster-specific data frames. Insights were extracted from the clusters, showcasing unique and interesting features for each group. Finally, distinct names were suggested for the clusters based on their characteristic attributes. Overall, this project demonstrates an understanding of clustering analysis and provides meaningful interpretations of the results.
